This project was a quick exercise after my initial reading of JEP draft: Structured Concurrency (Preview).

http://openjdk.java.net/jeps/8277129

One of the examples in the text is that of a "web crawler", which I tried to do.

This project is the result of a few hours of investment
after reading the corresponding documentation.

I hope it will help to assess the basic usability of the API:
this is the code which occurred to me right after reading documentation.

The Gradle scripts are not complete to compile the project.
I have used them by habit to import into Intellij IDEA
and then customize the compilation with the required flags.
