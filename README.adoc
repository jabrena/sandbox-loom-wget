This project was a quick exercise after my initial reading of JEP draft: Structured Concurrency (Preview).

In this exercise, I attempted to create a "fail fast web crawler"
which fails at the first broken link found.

This I did with the smallest possible effort I could,
with the purpose of putting API usability to the test.
